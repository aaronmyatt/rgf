# textualize LLM UI Development Instructions (2025)

_Last updated: August 2025_

- Always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component usage, install name, and best practices directly from the official textualize documentation: 
    - widgets: https://textual.textualize.io/widget_gallery/
    - reference: https://textual.textualize.io/reference/
    
- Do not rely on what you think you know about textualize components, as they are frequently updated and improved. Your training data is outdated.
- For any textualize component, CLI command, or usage pattern, fetch the relevant page from the docs and follow the instructions there.

**Core Principles:**
- textualize components are open code: you are expected to read, modify, and extend them directly.
- Copy and paste the code from the docs, then modify it to fit your needs.
- Use the fetch tool to get the latest code examples and usage patterns.
- Follow accessibility and composition best practices as described in the docs.
- Please fetch ready made components, whenever possible, rather than writing from scratch.

**Summary:**
> For all textualize work, always use the fetch tool to look up the latest component documentation and usage from:
- widgets: https://textual.textualize.io/widget_gallery/
- reference: https://textual.textualize.io/reference/

Do not rely on static instructions.
